## What is AR?
Augmented Reality has been judged as one of 2010’s hottest trends. The concept behind it is pretty simple, over lay the physical world with cool graphics that appear to occupy the same space as you.

Lots of companies have used it as a great promotional tool. Adidas have recently put them on their shoes and made a very cool looking game.

Lego use it as a way to visualize what their products will look like when you’ve finished building them.

## Intro to flARToolkit?
flARToolkit is the flash version of the C-coded augmented reality library known simply as ARToolkit. It was converted over by a very very skilled Japanese coder known as saqoosha. He does all kinds of crazy stuff with augmented reality and if you can read Japanese or are prepared to wade through lots of posts that barely make sense when translated, then you can learn a lot from him. He created the infamous ‘hole in the wall’ effect which is demonstrated in the New Years celebration project he created to welcome in 2009.
